# Big Sales Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor

This repository contains the code and data for a machine learning project aimed at predicting sales across various outlets using the Random Forest Regressor.

## Project Overview

### Title of Project:
Big Sales Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor

### Objective:
To gain a deep understanding of the dataset and predict sales using a machine learning model.

### Data Source:
A dataset containing features like Item_Identifier, Item_Weight, Item_Fat_Content, Item_Visibility, Item_Type, Item_MRP, Outlet_Identifier, Outlet_Establishment_Year, Outlet_Size, Outlet_Location_Type, Outlet_Type, and Item_Outlet_Sales.

## Steps Involved:

1. **Import Library**:
   - Utilized Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and modeling.

2. **Import Data**:
   - Loaded the dataset into Google Colab for analysis.

3. **Describe Data**:
   - Performed a thorough description of the dataset, including statistical summaries and feature exploration.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualized key features and relationships using plots and charts.

5. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables to prepare for modeling.

6. **Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X)**:
   - Identified Item_Outlet_Sales as the target variable and other relevant features as predictors.

7. **Train Test Split**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance.

8. **Modeling**:
   - Built the prediction model using the Random Forest Regressor.

9. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated the model using metrics such as RMSE and R² to ensure accuracy and reliability.

10. **Prediction**:
    - Predicted sales on the test set and compared with actual values.
